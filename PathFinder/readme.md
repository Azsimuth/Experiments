This is attempt number two. I finally figured out a way to do weighted random (i think i did), it could be possibly wrong. The thing i'm concerned about is that something
has went wrong again, since it seems the green rectangle feels really dumb even now. I migth need to be more patient with it maybe, but that's not even the biggest problem
let's say i move the flag. All the training it had goes to waste, since it really only learns a path, and not to get to the red object, which is the flag.
I have an idea, possibly taking screenshots, running them trough some fancy python script, and the it may output something. I though have no clue just what i'd
actually have to do to make it learn really. All i know is with GML only, it is impossible i think. I could tell the AI the position of the flag and all, but maybe
that's cheating. And what about is this learning? Sure a path, and the choiches are weighted, but if i move the flag, and even if i tell it where it is, how on earth will
i be able to make it think? This may be beyond the capabilities of the avarage high schooler.
